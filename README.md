## About the project
This notebook contains Neural Network,LSTM,and API to predict sentiment from text and datasets.

Neural Network uses the MLPClassifier model from sklearn.

LSTM uses the Sequential model from tensorflow.

The API contains 4 endpoints i.e. Neural Network in text and file form, and LSTM in text and file form.

if the code does not work properly, you can download and install package from "new_requirements.txt".

train_preprocess.tsv.txt is the training data.

data.csv is the test data.

new_kamusalay contains a list of mistyping and slang words.
